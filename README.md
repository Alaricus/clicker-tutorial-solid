# Clicker Game Tutorial

## Work In Progress

This is a SolidJS version of a [similar tutorial](https://github.com/Alaricus/clicker-tutorial-react) that I created for React in 2020.

At the moment, while the majority of the code is ready, I am still not finished setting everything up in the exact way that I like, and am still writing the tutorial itself. Once I'm done, it will appear here. The game itself is functional so feel free to pull and pick at it, but keep in mind it's not the final version.
